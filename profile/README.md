> **We route intelligence. We don't build it.**

## What Is This?

BlackRoad is an orchestration layer that connects users to the intelligence that already exists - Claude, GPT, Llama, databases, APIs, and more.

We don't train models. We don't buy GPUs. We route requests to the right tool at the right time.
