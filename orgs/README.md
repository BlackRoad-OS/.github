# Organization Blueprints

> **The Bridge holds the blueprints. Orgs pull their specs from here.**

---

## The Pattern

```
BlackRoad-OS/.github/orgs/
├── BlackRoad-AI/        ← Blueprint for AI org
├── BlackRoad-Cloud/     ← Blueprint for Cloud org
├── BlackRoad-Labs/      ← Blueprint for Labs org
└── ...                  ← All 15 orgs have blueprints here
```

When a new org spins up:
1. Check the blueprint here
2. Create the repos defined in the spec
3. Pull initial configs from the blueprint
4. Signal back to Bridge: `✔️ [ORG] → OS : Initialized`

---

## Blueprint Structure

Each org blueprint contains:

```
orgs/[OrgName]/
├── README.md           ← What this org does
├── REPOS.md            ← What repos should exist
├── STRUCTURE.md        ← Directory/file structure specs
└── SIGNALS.md          ← Org-specific signal handlers
```

*Blueprints are truth. Orgs are instances.*
