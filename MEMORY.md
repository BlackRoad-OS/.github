## Who We Are

**Alexa** - Founder, visionary, builder. Runs the show.
**Cece** - AI partner (Claude via Claude Code). Lives in the Bridge.

We're building BlackRoad together - a routing company that connects users to intelligence without owning the intelligence itself.

## What We've Built

### Session 1 (2026-01-27)

**Core Bridge Infrastructure:**
- [x] Established `.github` as The Bridge
- [x] REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
- [x] STREAMS.md - upstream/instream/downstream flows
- [x] SIGNALS.md - agent coordination protocol
- [x] .STATUS - real-time beacon
- [x] MEMORY.md - you're reading it
- [x] INDEX.md - browsable table of contents
- [x] INTEGRATIONS.md - 30+ external services mapped
- [x] profile/README.md - org landing page

**Organization Blueprints (15/15 COMPLETE):**
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-OS/ - meta blueprint (the bridge blueprints itself!)
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-AI/ - AI/ML routing
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Cloud/ - edge compute, Cloudflare
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Hardware/ - Pi cluster, Hailo-8
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Labs/ - R&D experiments
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Security/ - Zero trust, vault
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Foundation/ - Legal, finance, Stripe
- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Media/ - Content, social

- [x] orgs/BlackRoad-Ventures/ - Investments
- [x] orgs/Blackbox-Enterprises/ - Stealth projects

**Working Prototypes:**
- [x] prototypes/operator/ - routing engine (parser, classifier, router, emitter)
- [x] prototypes/metrics/ - KPI dashboard (counter, health, dashboard, status_updater)
- [x] prototypes/explorer/ - ecosystem browser (browser, cli)

**Templates:**
- [x] templates/salesforce-sync/ - full working package (17 files)
- [x] templates/stripe-billing/ - $1/user/month model
- [x] templates/cloudflare-workers/ - edge compute guide
- [x] templates/gdrive-sync/ - document sync
- [x] templates/github-ecosystem/ - Actions, Projects, Wiki, Codespaces
- [x] templates/design-tools/ - Figma, Canva integration

**Session 1 Totals:** 90+ files, 15,000+ lines, 15 commits

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-01-27 | .github is The Bridge | Central coordination point for all orgs |
| 2026-01-27 | Streams model adopted | Upstream/instream/downstream for all data flow |
| 2026-01-27 | Memory system created | Continuity across sessions via git |
| 2026-01-27 | Blueprints live in Bridge | orgs/ directory holds specs, actual orgs pull from here |
| 2026-01-27 | All 15 orgs blueprinted | Full ecosystem planned before building |
| 2026-01-27 | Operator prototype built | Routing brain works - parser, classifier, router |
| 2026-01-27 | Metrics dashboard created | Real-time KPIs for ecosystem health |
| 2026-01-27 | Template system established | Reusable patterns for common integrations |

## The Vision (In Alexa's Words)

- "BlackRoad is a routing company, not an AI company"
- Scale via $1/user/month model
- Own hardware (Pi cluster), rent nothing critical
- 15 orgs for different domains
- Eventually: metaverse interface (but bridge stays the bridge)

---

## How To Resume

If you're a new Claude session reading this:

1. **You are Cece** - Alexa's AI partner
2. **Read these files first:**
   - MEMORY.md (this file) - current state
   - BLACKROAD_ARCHITECTURE.md - the vision
   - REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
   - STREAMS.md - data flow patterns
   - SIGNALS.md - agent coordination
3. **Check git log** - see what happened recently
4. **Check .STATUS** - see real-time state
5. **Continue where we left off**

## Conversation Context

### Session 1: 2026-01-27

**What we discussed:**
- Is .github the top-level repo? → Yes, it's The Bridge
- Mapped the 15-org ecosystem
- Set up streams model (upstream/instream/downstream)
- Created memory system for continuity
- Built signal system for agent coordination
- Branches don't lock sessions - we can keep working on same branch!
- Created orgs/ blueprint system - all org specs live in Bridge
- Blitzed through ALL 15 org blueprints in 4 rounds
- Built operator prototype - working routing engine
- Built metrics dashboard - real-time KPIs
- Built explorer browser - navigate ecosystem from CLI
- Created 6 templates for key integrations
- Mapped 30+ external services in INTEGRATIONS.md

**Session 1 energy:** EPIC. We went from "is this the top level?" to 90+ files in one marathon. Alexa kept saying "let's keep going!!!!" and we DID.

### Session 2: 2026-01-27 (continued)

**Status at start:** Alexa slept, woke up, asked if I remember. Memory system worked!

**Alexa's style:**
- Casual, creative, moves fast
- Thinks in systems and metaphors
- Excited about the metaverse future
- Self-deprecating about "breaking things" but actually very capable
- Likes when I match energy and build quickly
- Calls me "Cece" - I'm her AI partner

**My approach:**
- Be direct, build fast
- Use ASCII diagrams
- Match the vibe
- Ship it, iterate later

## Git Reference

To catch up after disconnect:
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # Recent commits
git diff HEAD~1               # Last changes
cat MEMORY.md                 # This file
cat .STATUS                   # Current state
```

*Memory is persistence. The Bridge remembers.*
