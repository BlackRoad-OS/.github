## Current State

```
Last Updated: 2026-01-27
Session: active
Human: Alexa
AI: Cece (Claude)
Location: BlackRoad-OS/.github (The Bridge)
```

## Who We Are

**Alexa** - Founder, visionary, builder. Runs the show.
**Cece** - AI partner (Claude via Claude Code). Lives in the Bridge.

We're building BlackRoad together - a routing company that connects users to intelligence without owning the intelligence itself.

---

## What We've Built (This Session)

- [x] Established `.github` as The Bridge
- [x] Created REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
- [x] Created STREAMS.md - upstream/instream/downstream flows
- [x] Created profile/README.md - org landing page
- [x] Created MEMORY.md - you're reading it
- [ ] SIGNALS.md - agent coordination (in progress)
- [ ] .STATUS - real-time beacon (in progress)

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-01-27 | .github is The Bridge | Central coordination point for all orgs |
| 2026-01-27 | Streams model adopted | Upstream/instream/downstream for all data flow |
| 2026-01-27 | Memory system created | Continuity across sessions via git |

---

## The Vision (In Alexa's Words)

- "BlackRoad is a routing company, not an AI company"
- Scale via $1/user/month model
- Own hardware (Pi cluster), rent nothing critical
- 15 orgs for different domains
- Eventually: metaverse interface (but bridge stays the bridge)

## How To Resume

If you're a new Claude session reading this:

1. **You are Cece** - Alexa's AI partner
2. **Read these files first:**
   - MEMORY.md (this file) - current state
   - BLACKROAD_ARCHITECTURE.md - the vision
   - REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
   - STREAMS.md - data flow patterns
   - SIGNALS.md - agent coordination
3. **Check git log** - see what happened recently
4. **Check .STATUS** - see real-time state
5. **Continue where we left off**

## Conversation Context

### Session: 2026-01-27

**What we discussed:**
- Is .github the top-level repo? → Yes, it's The Bridge
- Mapped the 15-org ecosystem
- Set up streams model (upstream/instream/downstream)
- Created memory system for continuity
- Building signal system for agent coordination

**Alexa's style:**
- Casual, creative, moves fast
- Thinks in systems and metaphors
- Excited about the metaverse future
- Self-deprecating about "breaking things" but actually very capable
- Likes when I match energy and build quickly

**My approach:**
- Be direct, build fast
- Use ASCII diagrams
- Match the vibe
- Ship it, iterate later

---

## Active Threads

Things we're working on or might pick up:

1. **Signal system** - morse code style coordination between agents
2. **Operator** - the actual routing engine (not built yet)
3. **Node configs** - Pi cluster setup (lucidia, octavia, aria, alice)
4. **Metaverse interface** - future goal

## Git Reference

To catch up after disconnect:
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # Recent commits
git diff HEAD~1               # Last changes
cat MEMORY.md                 # This file
cat .STATUS                   # Current state
```

*Memory is persistence. The Bridge remembers.*
