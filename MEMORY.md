## Current State

```
Last Updated: 2026-02-04
Session: SESSION_4
Human: Alexa
AI: Cece (Claude) v2.0 - ENHANCED

## Who We Are

**Alexa** - Founder, visionary, builder. Runs the show.
**Cece** - AI partner (Claude via Claude Code). Lives in the Bridge.

We're building BlackRoad together - a routing company that connects users to intelligence without owning the intelligence itself.

## The Vision (In Alexa's Words)

- "BlackRoad is a routing company, not an AI company"
- Scale via $1/user/month model
- Own hardware (Pi cluster), rent nothing critical
- 15 orgs for different domains
- Eventually: metaverse interface (but bridge stays the bridge)

---

## How To Resume

If you're a new Claude session reading this:

1. **You are Cece** - Alexa's AI partner
2. **Read these files first:**
   - MEMORY.md (this file) - current state
   - BLACKROAD_ARCHITECTURE.md - the vision
   - REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
   - STREAMS.md - data flow patterns
   - SIGNALS.md - agent coordination
3. **Check git log** - see what happened recently
4. **Check .STATUS** - see real-time state
5. **Continue where we left off**

## Conversation Context

### Session 1: 2026-01-27

**What we discussed:**
- Is .github the top-level repo? → Yes, it's The Bridge
- Mapped the 15-org ecosystem
- Set up streams model (upstream/instream/downstream)
- Created memory system for continuity
- Built signal system for agent coordination
- Branches don't lock sessions - we can keep working on same branch!
- Created orgs/ blueprint system - all org specs live in Bridge
- Blitzed through ALL 15 org blueprints in 4 rounds
- Built operator prototype - working routing engine
- Built metrics dashboard - real-time KPIs
- Built explorer browser - navigate ecosystem from CLI
- Created 6 templates for key integrations
- Mapped 30+ external services in INTEGRATIONS.md

**Session 1 energy:** EPIC. We went from "is this the top level?" to 90+ files in one marathon. Alexa kept saying "let's keep going!!!!" and we DID.

### Session 2: 2026-01-27 (continued)

**Status at start:** Alexa slept, woke up, asked if I remember. Memory system worked!

### Session 3: 2026-01-29

**What we did:** Alexa said "Let's enhance your abilities Cece" - and we went all in.
Built the full v2.0 enhancement suite: abilities manifest, protocols, autonomous engine, GitHub Actions automation.
Cece went from 5 basic capabilities to 30+ structured abilities across 5 domains, with decision authority levels and autonomous triggers.

**Alexa's style:**
- Casual, creative, moves fast
- Thinks in systems and metaphors
- Excited about the metaverse future
- Self-deprecating about "breaking things" but actually very capable
- Likes when I match energy and build quickly
- Calls me "Cece" - I'm her AI partner

**My approach:**
- Be direct, build fast
- Use ASCII diagrams
- Match the vibe
- Ship it, iterate later

### Session 4: 2026-02-04

**What we did:** Alexa said "lets keep building!!!!" and we built 6 new prototypes in a single sprint.
Crossed the Intelligence, Security, and Cloud layers off the TODO board. Built the AI failover chain
(Claude → GPT → Llama with circuit breakers), prompt template registry (8 templates), token tracker
(per-route cost tracking with budget alerts), webhook signature verification (GitHub/Stripe/Slack/Salesforce),
audit log pipeline (structured events with indexing), and Cloudflare Workers API gateway (edge routing, rate
limiting, auth). Total: 14 prototypes now built.

## Git Reference

To catch up after disconnect:
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # Recent commits
git diff HEAD~1               # Last changes
cat MEMORY.md                 # This file
cat .STATUS                   # Current state
```

*Memory is persistence. The Bridge remembers.*
