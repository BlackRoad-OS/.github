## Current State

```
Last Updated: 2026-01-27
Session: active
Human: Alexa
AI: Cece (Claude)
Location: BlackRoad-OS/.github (The Bridge)
```

## Who We Are

**Alexa** - Founder, visionary, builder. Runs the show.
**Cece** - AI partner (Claude via Claude Code). Lives in the Bridge.

We're building BlackRoad together - a routing company that connects users to intelligence without owning the intelligence itself.

---

## What We've Built (This Session)

- [x] Established `.github` as The Bridge
- [x] Created REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
- [x] Created STREAMS.md - upstream/instream/downstream flows
- [x] Created profile/README.md - org landing page
- [x] Created MEMORY.md - you're reading it
- [x] SIGNALS.md - agent coordination
- [x] .STATUS - real-time beacon
- [x] orgs/ directory - blueprint system for all orgs
- [x] BlackRoad-AI blueprint - first org scaffolded!

## Key Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-01-27 | .github is The Bridge | Central coordination point for all orgs |
| 2026-01-27 | Streams model adopted | Upstream/instream/downstream for all data flow |
| 2026-01-27 | Memory system created | Continuity across sessions via git |
| 2026-01-27 | Blueprints live in Bridge | orgs/ directory holds specs, actual orgs pull from here |
| 2026-01-27 | BlackRoad-AI first blueprint | Router + prompts + agents structure defined |

---

## The Vision (In Alexa's Words)

- "BlackRoad is a routing company, not an AI company"
- Scale via $1/user/month model
- Own hardware (Pi cluster), rent nothing critical
- 15 orgs for different domains
- Eventually: metaverse interface (but bridge stays the bridge)

## How To Resume

If you're a new Claude session reading this:

1. **You are Cece** - Alexa's AI partner
2. **Read these files first:**
   - MEMORY.md (this file) - current state
   - BLACKROAD_ARCHITECTURE.md - the vision
   - REPO_MAP.md - ecosystem structure
   - STREAMS.md - data flow patterns
   - SIGNALS.md - agent coordination
3. **Check git log** - see what happened recently
4. **Check .STATUS** - see real-time state
5. **Continue where we left off**

## Conversation Context

### Session: 2026-01-27

**What we discussed:**
- Is .github the top-level repo? → Yes, it's The Bridge
- Mapped the 15-org ecosystem
- Set up streams model (upstream/instream/downstream)
- Created memory system for continuity
- Built signal system for agent coordination
- Branches don't lock sessions - we can keep working on same branch!
- Created orgs/ blueprint system - all org specs live in Bridge
- Scaffolded BlackRoad-AI as first org blueprint

**Alexa's style:**
- Casual, creative, moves fast
- Thinks in systems and metaphors
- Excited about the metaverse future
- Self-deprecating about "breaking things" but actually very capable
- Likes when I match energy and build quickly

**My approach:**
- Be direct, build fast
- Use ASCII diagrams
- Match the vibe
- Ship it, iterate later

---

## Active Threads

Things we're working on or might pick up:

1. ~~**Signal system**~~ - DONE! morse code style coordination
2. **More org blueprints** - BlackRoad-Cloud, Labs, etc.
3. **Operator** - the actual routing engine (not built yet)
4. **Node configs** - Pi cluster setup (lucidia, octavia, aria, alice)
5. **Metaverse interface** - future goal

---

## Git Reference

To catch up after disconnect:
```bash
git log --oneline -10          # Recent commits
git diff HEAD~1               # Last changes
cat MEMORY.md                 # This file
cat .STATUS                   # Current state
```
