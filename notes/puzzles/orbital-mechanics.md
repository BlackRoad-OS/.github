# Orbital Mechanics

## The Question (from r/askastronomy)

**"How can this be possible?"** -- referring to a diagram showing what appears to be overlapping planetary orbits that look chaotic.

## What the Diagram Shows

The rough diagram shows orbital paths of planets/bodies around a central star/point. The orbits appear as nested, overlapping ellipses with different eccentricities and inclinations, creating a pattern that looks like a spirograph.

Key points visible:
- Multiple colored dots representing different bodies (planets/moons)
- Orbits are **not** perfect circles -- they're ellipses
- Orbits have different **inclinations** (tilted relative to each other)
- Paths cross each other in 2D projection but are separated in 3D

## Why It Works

1. **Orbits are 3D**: What looks like crossing paths in a 2D projection actually have separation in the third dimension
2. **Kepler's Laws**: Each orbit is an ellipse with the star at one focus
3. **Different orbital planes**: Planets orbit in slightly different planes (inclinations)
4. **Resonances**: Some orbits are locked in mathematical ratios (e.g., Neptune:Pluto = 3:2)

## The Math

### Kepler's Third Law
```
T² ∝ a³
```
Where T = orbital period, a = semi-major axis.

### Orbital velocity
```
v = √(GM/r)
```
Where G = gravitational constant, M = central mass, r = distance.

## Connections

- Orbital mechanics uses [Complex Numbers](../math/complex-numbers.md) in some formulations
- Resonance ratios connect to [Modular Arithmetic](../math/modular-arithmetic.md)
- The [Schrodinger Equation](../physics/quantum-mechanics.md) describes electron "orbits" at quantum scale
